# Enhancing Drifting Stream Multi-Class Classification with One-Vs-Rest Strategies

## Abstract
Dynamic environments present substantial challenges for machine learning models due to concept drift, where the underlying data distribution changes over time. Concept drift can affect subsets of classes either globally or locally, complicating the adaptation process. While informed drift detectors have been developed to address this issue, no existing online classifier leverages class-informed drift detection for targeted adaptation. To address this gap, we introduce the One-Vs-Rest Drift-Aware (OvR-DA) framework, a novel approach designed to enhance predictive performance in multi-class data streams with concept drift. OvR-DA integrates a robust data decomposition technique with a class-informed drift detector, enabling rapid and efficient adaptation to both local and global drifts without compromising overall performance. Through comprehensive experimentation and comparisons with six state-of-the-art classifiers and various One-Vs-Rest strategy variations, the proposed OvR-DA classifier consistently outperformed all non-ensemble methods and achieved competitive results with ensemble models while utilizing significantly fewer computational resources. These findings confirm the effectiveness of OvR-DA in handling multi-class scenarios involving both local and global concept drifts. This study enhances the adaptability and robustness of machine learning systems in dynamic environments, advancing data stream learning and improving the reliability of machine learning applications in evolving scenarios.
